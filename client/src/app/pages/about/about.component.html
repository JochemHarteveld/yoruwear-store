              YoruWear started with a simple idea: what if your outfit could join the music?
              Founder Jochem Harteveld, inspired by the energy of festivals and the fusion of sound and creativity, 
              combined his love for technology, design, and nightlife to create something new ‚Äî fashion that reacts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The word "Yoru" means night in Japanese ‚Äî a symbol of the moment when everything comes alive: 
              lights, beats, and people. From a small studio in Leiden, we're designing clothing that turns 
              sound into light, and moments into memories.

        Every YoruWear piece merges premium fabric with smart technology. 
        Inside each garment, tiny sensors and LEDs react to the sound around you ‚Äî 
        syncing with your favorite tracks or the pulse of the crowd. 
        It's wearable art, powered by rhythm and connection.
